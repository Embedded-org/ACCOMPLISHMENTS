# Trading Analytics for Day Trading in Stock Market

A rule-based model is being developed to do hypothesis testing to determine whether the chosen stock's price is crossing any of the following moving averages: the 7-day, 13-day, 20-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages. It will be a purchase decision if the projection indicates that the value will be higher than various Moving Averages. Exponential Time series Models will be used to create the same five hypothesis testing models. 

After that, five further ARIMA-based time series models is created to support the buy or sell recommendation for every stock.

Various Classification models namely AutoKeras Classification Model (Structured Data Classifier), K-neighbours Classifier Model, and Logistic Regression Classification Model deployed and their prediction accuracy is being compared with SMA Models, EMA Models, and ARIMA Models. 


Further ahead various Regression Models including both Machine Learning and Deep learning techniques are deployed and Metrics namely MAE and MAPE are deployed to estimate the quality of the predictions on the close price of the HDFC share. These Regression Models are the OLS-Linear Regression Model, Lasso Regression Model, Lasso regression Model Using Cross Validation, The KNN Algorithm, Decision Tree Algorithm, GridSearchCV Algorithm with Hyperparameter Tuning, Random Forest Regression Model, XGBoost ML Model, Using PCA with LSTM, Using PCA with LSTM with Moving Average variables (Feature Engineering), LSTM Neural Network Model, Regression Model using AutoKeras.
